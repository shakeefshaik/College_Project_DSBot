# Ask Your Data — Supporting Data Science Processes by Combining AutoML and Conversational Interfaces

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is inspired by the research paper *“Ask Your Data—Supporting Data Science Processes by Combining AutoML and Conversational Interfaces.”* It aims to simplify the data science workflow by allowing users to interact with datasets through a **no-code, conversational interface**. Built using Python and Streamlit, the tool automates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning model generation using PyCaret.

## 🎯 Motivation
In the era of AI, manual data processing and coding-heavy workflows can be barriers for non-technical users. This project was developed to bridge that gap—making data science accessible through clicks and natural language, without writing a single line of code.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Upload CSV datasets** via UI  
- **Automated Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, outliers, and formatting  
- **EDA Engine**: Generates statistical summaries and insights  
- **Visualization Module**: Creates bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, etc.  
- **AutoML Integration**: Uses PyCaret to build and evaluate ML models  
- **Q&A Engine**: Responds to simple user queries using sentence-matching logic

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, PyCaret, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Framework**: Streamlit  
- **Other Tools**: Regex, basic NLP for query matching
